## Create Class

Convert the give image into class using inheritance.

- `name` is the property
- `eat()` is the method

Property ending with `()` is method. And others are properties.

![Inheritance](../assets/inheritance.png)

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, gender) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
  }
  eat() {}
  sleep() {}
  walk() {}
}
```
